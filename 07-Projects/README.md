# 07. Deep Learning Projects 🛠️🚀

Hands-on projects to master deep learning from scratch to production level.

## Project 1: MNIST Digit Classifier (From Scratch) 🔢
*   **Goal**: Build a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using only **NumPy** to understand the math behind Forward and Backward propagation.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy.
*   **Key Learning**: Matrix multiplication, manual derivation of gradients, and SGD implementation.

## Project 2: Dog vs. Cat Classifier (CNN) 🐕🐈
*   **Goal**: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to achieve >90% accuracy on the famous Kaggle dataset.
*   **Tech Stack**: PyTorch, TorchVision.
*   **Key Learning**: Data Augmentation, Dropout, Pooling, and saving/loading model weights.

## Project 3: Sequence Character Predictor (LSTM) ⌨️
*   **Goal**: Train an LSTM model to predict the next character in a text sequence (e.g., Shakespeare or Linux Source Code).
*   - **Tech Stack**: PyTorch, RNN.
*   **Key Learning**: Tokenization, Hidden states, and handling sequential data.

## Project 4: Custom Image Search Engine (Transfer Learning) 🔍
*   **Goal**: Use a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract feature vectors (embeddings) from a folder of images and find the "most similar" images to a query.
*   **Tech Stack**: PyTorch, FAISS (Vector search).
*   **Key Learning**: Using models as feature extractors and distance-based search.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Framework**: Focus on **PyTorch**. It is the most common framework in research and modern AI companies.
2.  **Dataset**: Start with **MNIST** or **CIFAR-10**. They are small enough to train on a standard laptop CPU.
3.  **Visualization**: Use **TensorBoard** or **Weights & Biases** to plot your training and validation loss curves in real-time.
