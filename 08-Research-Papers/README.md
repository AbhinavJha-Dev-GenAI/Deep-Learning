# 08. Essential Deep Learning Research Papers 📚🕵️‍♂️

The papers that defined the eras of Deep Learning.

## The Foundations
1.  **Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition (LeCun et al., 1989)**: The birth of CNNs. [Read Paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf)
2.  **ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (AlexNet, 2012)**: The paper that started the "Deep Learning Revolution." [Read Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)

## Architectures & Innovations
3.  **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet, 2015)**: Introduced skip connections to solve vanishing gradients. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
4.  **Attention Is All You Need (Transformers, 2017)**: The foundation for GPT, BERT, and all modern LLMs. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

## Optimization & Regularization
5.  **Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization (2014)**: The most popular optimizer in the world. [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)
6.  **Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training (2015)**: [Read Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)

> [!TIP]
> **Must Read**: If you only read one, read **ResNet (2015)**. It explains why deep networks failed before skip connections and changed architecture design forever.
